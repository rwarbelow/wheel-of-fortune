      <li>Shhhh... this is a secret and I'd like to keep it that way. Please don't share the news, not even with your best friends! Not even with the disclaimer of <i>"Rachel doesn't want me to tell anyone yet, but..."</i> There are lots of reasons I don't want many people knowing right now. If/when that changes, I'll let you all know.</li>
      <li>Being barraged with questions (about the baby's sex, health, etc.), and comments (about how big or small my body is, etc.), and judgement (about choosing to be a single parent, etc.), and speculation, will give me massive stress and anxiety, so please don't do that.</li>
      <li>Just so nobody thinks I'm being financially irresponsible: the baby was planned and budgeted for far in advance. I have an entirely separate account for all of the baby things I'll need to spend on, so there is no need for anyone to buy anything for the baby. If you're dying to spend money, donate it to somewhere like <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a>, <a href="https://everymothercounts.org/">Every Mother Counts</a>, <a href="https://familypromise.org/">Family Promise</a>, or <a href="https://www.nhsa.org/get-involved/donate/">HeadStart</a>.</li>
      <li>If any of you are looking for a full-time babysitting job for the next two years, inquire within. ðŸ˜‚</li>
